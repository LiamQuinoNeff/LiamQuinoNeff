- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam Quino Neff (@LiamQuinoNeff). I'm a Computer Science student, amateur Game Designer and a professional voice actor
- 👀 I’m interested in video game development, cyber-security and a little bit of A.I
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Python, but I also want to learn C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects that can help me expand my knowledge and portfolio, although I'm more inclined to videogame and cyber-security projects.
